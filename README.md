## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design

### What I learned

During this challenge I learned an approach called BEM and started using REM for accessibility.

### Continued development

In future projects I would like to focus on using an approach called BEM, learn SASS and CSS Grid.

### Useful resources

- [CSS REM â€“ What is REM in CSS?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-rem-in-css/#:~:text=Using%20REM%20or%20another%20relative,due%20to%20a%20visual%20impairment.) - This helped me learn about REM.
- [Block Element Modifier](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/bem_by_example) - This helped me to consider an approach called BEM. I would recommend it to anyone who is still learning this.
